# Inspiration

For our third Assignment in my Data Structures and Algorithms course in the University of Calgary([CPSC 331](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/cpsc/courses/f19/CPSC331?destination=courses)), we had to learn about how [HashTables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) work. So for this assignment, we had to implement a [HashTable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) using a linked list (in Java) and use it as a Database to store Student names and their respective ages. After completing the implementation in Java. I decided to challenge myself and try to implement it in TypeScript and make a web application that can visualize the HashTable and how the data is stored.


# What it does

This is a web application that visualizes a [HashTable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) and how it's data is stored. The data used is a list of Student objects and each Student object has a name and an age

what it can currently do:
- visualize the HashTable
- add new data to the HashTable
- remove data from the HashTable
- search for data in the HashTable
- increment the age of a Student
- reset the HashTable

# Technologies used

- **[NextJs](https://nextjs.org/)** to create a full-stack [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) Application.
    - 2nd project using it
- **[Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/)** to use fast accessible react components to make me focus my time on the more complex features.
    - 1st project using it
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** to make cool animations in ReactJs
    - 2nd project using it
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** to style the application with CSS in an extremely fast way.
    - 1st project using it
    - Now I see why web developers love it lol.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescript.org/)** to write the code in a way that is more readable and easy to maintain.
    - 2nd project using it

# Future plans

- I plan to make this website not only have one visualization of the HashTable, but instead, I'll have a home page that show a list of several different Data Structures and Algorithms(sorting, searching) visualized.
- But for now, I will be trying to make the visualization of the HashTable an actual visualization because now it's just text. And also make the HashTable interactive and fun to mess around with while still showing the back-end(inside structure) of the HashTable.
